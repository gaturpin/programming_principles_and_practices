1. 	What is a computation?
	Producing output based on some input

2. 	What do we mean by inputs and outputs to a computation?
	Something going into and out of a computer

3. 	Three requirements a programmer should keep in mind when expressing 	computations?
	- correctly
	- simply
	- efficiently

4. 	What does an expression do?
	Computes a value from a number of operands

5. 	What is the difference between a statement and an expression?
	statement - tells computer to perform specific task
	expression - computes a value

6. 	What is an lvalue?
	expression that identifies an object

	Operators that require lvalues:
	asignment a = 1;
	increment ++a;
	address of &a;

7. 	What is a const expression?
	Value can't change after initialisation

8. 	What is a literal?
	Represents values of various types
 	literal 12 - represents value twelve
 	literal "hi" - represents characters hi

9.	What is a symbolic constant?
	Name as identifier, e.g. pi etc.

10. What is a magic constant?
	Non-obvious literals in code
	3e8 - speed of light but not mentioned

11.	Operators we can use for integers and floating-points?
	+, -, *, /, <, >, <= etc.

12.	Operators on ints but not floats?
	++, --, %

13.	Operators on strings?	
	<<, >>, +, !=, ==

14.	When would a programmer prefer switch statement to an if statement?
	Clearer than nested if's if comparing a value

15.	common problems with switch statements?
	No break;
	can't use strings
	case labels must be constants

16.	Function of each part of the header line in a for loop?
	starts at, ends with, incrememnt

17.	When should for and while loops be used?
	while loop when you have condition but don't know when to stop

18.	How do you print numeric value of char?
	char = 'c'
	value = int(char)

19.	Describe what the line char foo(int x) means in a function definition.
	function has type char, name foo and takes x as an integer

20.	When should you define a separate function for part of a program?
	When you need to reuse the same piece of code

21.	What can you do to an int that you cannot do to a string?
	few things

22.	String but not to int?
	few things

23.	Index of 3rd element in vector?
	[2]

24.	How to write a for loop that prints every element of a vector?
	c++11:
	for(auto i: vector){
		cout << i
	}

25.	What does vector<char> alphabet(26); do?
	init a blank vector of chars with 26 elements.

26.	What does push_back() do?
	adds element with value to vector

27.	What do vector member functions begin() end and size do?
	begin() - beginning of vector
	end() - end
	size() - gets size

28. What makes vector so popular/useful?
	No need to specify size at initialisation

29.	How do you sort elements of a vector?
	sort(vector.begin(), vector.end())
