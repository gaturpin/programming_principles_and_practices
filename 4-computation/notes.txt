Literals - Constants - value is obvious


lvalue - something that points to a specific memory location
rvalue - doesn't point anywhere
eg:
	int x = 100;

100 - rvalue
x - lvalue

Constant expressions:
	- const
	- can't give it a new value after it has been initialized]
	- const double pi = 3.141 
	pi = 7 --> error


if (x==5);	 - legal but does nothing
	{y = 3;} - will be assigned regardless of if statement


if()
else if()
else

not an else-if statement. It's an else followed by if.
